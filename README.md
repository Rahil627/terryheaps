# About "terryheaps"

*terryheaps* is a personal framework I use for making games using heaps.io. It slightly resembles haxegon, but abandons the immediate mode approach. The idea is to let me use familiar commands like `Text.display` and `Gfx.drawimage` to create native heaps objects using syntax I'm very comfortable with, so I can get stuff up and running quickly.

You're free to try using this if you want, but it's unsupported and probably doesn't have much advantage over using heaps directly.

If you're reading this, you might be interested in some of the following heaps based game frameworks:
  * [deepnightfr's gamebase](https://deepnight.net/tutorial/using-my-gamebase-to-create-a-heaps-game/) (some of the vscode settings for terryheaps are based on this)
  * [Yanrishatum's "heeps" library](https://github.com/Yanrishatum/heeps/)
  
## How to use

*terryheaps* is not on haxelib yet, so to use it:
 * Download this repo somewhere on your computer
 * Tell haxelib where to find the library with `haxelib dev terryheaps folder/to/terryheaps`
 * Download the [blank project]<https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/terryheaps/blob/master/blank%20framework.zip?raw=true> and open the folder with vscode.
 * You will need the following vscode plugins: `vscode-commandbar`, `Haxe`. If you've got it set up right, you'll get little compiler buttons like this in vscode:
